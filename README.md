**` Spatial Computing Developer `**

 Leveraging my expertise in Unity, Xcode, C#, and Swift (though Python holds a special place in my heart!), I'm constantly seeking innovative ways to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

 When I'm not coding, you can find me practicing Jiu Jitsu, exploring the latest spatial computing advancements, tinkering with open-source projects, or simply enjoying the beauty of the real world (often with a healthy dose of augmented reality, of course!).

 Connect with me to discuss the future of spatial computing, collaborate on exciting projects, or just chat about the latest tech trends!
